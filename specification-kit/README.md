# Specification Kit

Specification Kit is a lightweight repository scaffold for authoring, reviewing,
and publishing technical specifications. It provides a consistent directory
layout, reusable templates, and contribution guidelines that help teams write
clear, auditable specifications with minimal setup.

## Repository structure
