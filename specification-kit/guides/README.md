# Guides

Author how-to guides, review checklists, and reference material for writers and
reviewers in this directory. Helpful examples include:

- Specification authoring checklist
- Review rubric focusing on clarity, completeness, and testability
- Glossary of terms used across your organization
- Style guide for diagrams, tables, and numbering

Organize guide documents using subfolders if the content grows beyond a handful
of files.
