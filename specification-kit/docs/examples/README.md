# Examples

Use this directory to maintain high-quality specification examples that writers
can reference when drafting new documents. Include specs that demonstrate best
practices, such as clear acceptance criteria, traceable requirements, and
concise decision rationale.

Consider tagging example specs by domain (e.g., backend, frontend, process)
using prefixes or subdirectories so readers can quickly find relevant material.
