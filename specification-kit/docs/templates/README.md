# Templates

Store reusable specification templates in this directory. Templates should cover
key sections such as overview, requirements, diagrams, and decision records so
that authors can quickly start writing.

## Recommended templates

- `architecture.md` – for high-level system or service designs
- `feature.md` – for product feature requirements and success metrics
- `process.md` – for operational procedures and runbooks

Each template should include front-matter metadata (title, authors, status,
reviewers) and clearly marked placeholders that explain what information the
writer needs to provide.
