# Tools

Automate quality checks and publishing workflows by placing scripts or
configuration files in this directory. Potential additions include:

- Markdown or reStructuredText linters
- Diagram generation scripts (e.g., PlantUML, Mermaid CLI wrappers)
- Specification validation tools that enforce required sections or metadata
- Continuous integration workflows for verifying spec quality

Document how to run each tool and list any dependencies so contributors can set
up the toolkit quickly.
