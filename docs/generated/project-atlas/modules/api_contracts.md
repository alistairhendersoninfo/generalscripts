## API and Integration Specification

            **Objective**: Define all service contracts, event payloads, and integration boundaries.

            1. Document REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and messaging interfaces. Include request/response bodies, status codes, headers, and error formats.
2. Capture authentication, authorisation, rate limiting, and versioning strategies.
3. Specify external API dependencies, including sandbox vs. production endpoints, contract testing requirements, and failover behaviour.
4. Generate OpenAPI or equivalent schema files saved under `docs/api/`.
