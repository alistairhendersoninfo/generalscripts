## Project Planning, Agile Cadence, and Governance

            **Objective**: Create a delivery roadmap aligned with Scrum/Agile practices and tooling automation.

            1. Break work into MVP and subsequent release increments, mapping epics, features, and user stories with acceptance criteria.
2. Define sprint length, ceremonies, Definition of Ready, and Definition of Done.
3. Generate a project plan that respects dependency ordering and only schedules parallel tasks when independence is guaranteed (maximum four concurrent workstreams).
4. Provide burndown/burnup reporting expectations and metrics.
5. Prepare automation scripts or CLI commands to duplicate the required GitHub project template, populate project items (not issues) with all tasks assigned to **alistairhendersoninfo** and status `Todo`, and replicate the same structure in ForgeJo.
6. Describe stage-gate criteria and how scripts should pull tasks as gates are cleared.
