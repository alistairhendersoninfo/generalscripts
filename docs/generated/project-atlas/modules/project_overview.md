## Project Vision, Outcomes, and Constraints

            **Objective**: Capture the overarching goals, measurable success criteria, domain background, and temporal constraints.

            1. Ask for an executive summary of the product, including target users, core problem statements, and differentiators.
2. Capture quantitative and qualitative success metrics (e.g., adoption targets, revenue goals, compliance thresholds).
3. Record explicit in-scope and out-of-scope items.
4. Identify budget, timeline, or resource constraints, including expectations for MVP, subsequent releases, and sunset considerations.
5. Summarise competitive landscape or existing solutions and any mandated integrations with current systems.
