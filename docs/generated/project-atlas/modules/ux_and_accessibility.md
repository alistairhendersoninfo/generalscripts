## User Experience, Visual Design, and Accessibility Standards

            **Objective**: Produce UX artefacts that satisfy usability and evolving accessibility regulations.

            1. Compile screen inventories with wireframes, component hierarchies, and navigation models. Output Markdown and companion Mermaid UI diagrams.
2. Capture interaction design for each user role, including responsive behaviour, keyboard navigation, and assistive technology support.
3. Explicitly ask about applicable accessibility legislation (e.g., WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549) and record additional organisational policies. Keep this module easy to modify as new laws emerge.
4. Identify content strategy requirements such as copy tone, localisation, error messaging, and empty states.
5. Produce Playwright-based UX regression scenarios aligned with the test strategy.
