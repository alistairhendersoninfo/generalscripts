## Security, Privacy, and Resilience Planning

            **Objective**: Integrate threat modelling, security controls, and resilience expectations from the start.

            1. Conduct high-level threat modelling (STRIDE or similar) and capture mitigations.
2. Define authentication, authorisation, encryption (in transit and at rest), key rotation, and secrets handling.
3. Capture privacy requirements including consent, data minimisation, DSAR/Right-to-be-forgotten workflows.
4. Plan penetration and vulnerability testing leveraging the Kali Linux toolchain. Document inputs/outputs for the MCP server that will orchestrate these tests.
5. Describe disaster recovery, RTO/RPO targets, chaos testing cadence, and monitoring/alerting thresholds.
