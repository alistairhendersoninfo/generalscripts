## Technology Stack and Deployment Blueprint

            **Objective**: Select and justify the end-to-end technology architecture, deployment targets, and integration standards.

            1. Discuss desired front-end frameworks, back-end runtimes, microservices vs. monolith patterns, and integration middleware.
2. Choose database technologies (transactional, analytical, cache, and memory agents) with justification based on data requirements.
3. Decide on hosting models (Docker, bare metal, cloud providers) and outline networking, load balancing, and CDN considerations.
4. Specify web servers, API gateways, message brokers, observability stack, and secrets management.
5. Capture coding standards, language versions, formatting rules, linting requirements, and architectural decision records needed.
6. Outline environment matrix (local, CI, staging, production) and required parity.
