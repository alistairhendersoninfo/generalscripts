## Documentation Suite and Knowledge Transfer

            **Objective**: Ensure both humans and LLM agents receive actionable documentation.

            1. Produce an `LLM_DESIGN.md` (Claude/Codex friendly) summarising architecture, conventions, and invocation instructions for the agent workforce.
2. Create human-readable guides covering installation, configuration, upgrades, and operational checklists.
3. Generate machine-readable TODO/backlog files (YAML or JSON) for automation and a synchronised human-readable counterpart.
4. Document memory agent configurations, including SQLite schemas, summarisation cadence, retention policies, and reset procedures.
5. Provide user manuals, FAQ, and troubleshooting guides stored under `docs/user/`.
6. Outline documentation publishing workflows for GitHub Pages (doc.github) and the ForgeJo equivalent.
