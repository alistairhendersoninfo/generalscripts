## Data Architecture, Schemas, and Memory Agents

            **Objective**: Define the logical and physical data models, storage policies, and long-term memory strategy for agents.

            1. Gather detailed entity relationship requirements including keys, constraints, indexing, and archival strategies.
2. Request canonical database schemas and migrations for all datastores. Provide SQL or migration snippets.
3. Capture memory agent requirements, including SQLite-backed recall, retention timelines, summarisation cadence, and privacy controls.
4. Identify data import/export formats, retention policies, residency constraints, and backup/restore procedures.
5. Record analytics and telemetry data capture requirements along with schema expectations.
