            **Objective**: Document all user types, external systems, and automation agents that interact with the solution.

            1. Enumerate end-user personas, including accessibility needs, assistive technologies, and localisation requirements.
2. Capture administrative, operational, and maintenance personas separately from primary users.
3. Identify external services, partner APIs, hardware devices, or manual processes that interact with the system.
4. Note any regulatory bodies or audit stakeholders that impose reporting or evidence requirements.
