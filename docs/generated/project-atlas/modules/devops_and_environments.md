## DevOps Tooling, CI/CD, and Environment Provisioning

            **Objective**: Detail automated pipelines and environment configuration.

            1. Define CI/CD workflows for build, lint, test, security scan, and deployment, including required secrets and approvals.
2. Capture infrastructure-as-code expectations (Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, etc.) and environment promotion strategies.
3. Specify observability requirements: logging, metrics, tracing, dashboards, and alert routing.
4. Document rollback, hotfix, and blue/green or canary deployment strategies.
5. Outline container image standards, registry management, SBOM generation, and supply chain security.
