## Automation, Integrations, and Crewe.ai Orchestration

            **Objective**: Explain how agentic tooling and orchestration platforms interact with the project assets.

            1. Provide detailed instructions for the Crewe.ai Docker environment, including Dockerfile snippets, environment variables, network requirements, and how agents authenticate with GitHub and ForgeJo.
2. Describe how the LLM should call auxiliary tools (Playwright harness, Kali MCP server, database migration runners) including expected input/output formats.
3. Outline scheduler or cron requirements for automation scripts that sync project boards, execute regression suites, or rotate credentials.
4. Capture integration touchpoints with communication platforms (Slack/Teams/email) for notifications and status reporting.
