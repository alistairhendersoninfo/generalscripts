## Comprehensive Testing and Quality Strategy

            **Objective**: Define executable tests covering happy and unhappy paths across all layers.

            1. Produce a test plan that enumerates manual and automated scenarios. For each UI flow, list explicit steps (buttons to click, data to enter) and expected outcomes.
2. Include negative tests covering invalid data, out-of-order steps, and random user actions to validate graceful degradation.
3. Align Playwright scripts for UX testing with the UX deliverables. Store in `tests/playwright/`.
4. Define API contract tests, integration tests, performance tests, and security testing sequences (including Kali-based penetration steps).
5. Provide coverage goals, test data management plans, and CI gating rules.
